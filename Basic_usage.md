# Basic Usage

## Fork the repository

If you have not done so already, please fork the repository hosted by ksteimel. Forking essentially creates a copy of the repository under your own username. This is done to prevent the other changes we're about to make from interfering with what everyone else is doing. 

To fork the repository, click the button near the top right of the repository's webpage that says "Fork". You should then see a dialogue informing you that the files are being copied. 

## Clone a repository

Cloning a repository creates a local version of the repository on the server. To clone the repository you just forked, visit the repository you just made (you should be able to find a link to the repository under your list of repositories on the left when you log in). On the front page of the repository, you will see a green button that says "Clone or download". Click this button and you will see a dialogue that provides a url. If the url listed does not begin with `https://`, click the link that says "Use HTTPS" in the top right of the dialogue box. Copy the url to your clipboard and then switch to the terminal. 

This url is essential to the clone command since it needs to know where to grab the repository files from. 
In your terminal, run the following command: 

```
git clone <repository url>
```

This will create a new folder in the folder you're currently in that has the contents of the repository. 
Some additional folders are also created in the project folder that help manage the repository. These are hidden by default.
